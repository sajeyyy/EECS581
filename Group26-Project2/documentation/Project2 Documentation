Additions

AI:
Added Addition gamemode to battleship allowing the player to play against the computer instead of another player.
All gamemodes will place ships randomly
    Easy: The AI will generate random coordinates everyturn and then see if they are valid guesses. Even if a ship is hit the next turn will be randomly generated
    Medium: The AI will perform the same as the Easy Gamemode except when a ship is hit it will guess the spaces around the hit until the ship is sank
    Hard: The AI will scan the board then only guess the spaces where there are ships


AC 130(Special Shot):
    This is a power up during gameplay which is activated when you have three consecutive hits. After unlocking it will prompt you to use the power up, prompt for row or column,
    and prompt for which row or column you want to hit. After the prompt is complete there will be a short animation then the entire row/column will be targeted.
    After the use, it will deactivate and waits for three more consecutive hits.

Color:
    Added Color to the Water ~ and the X markers in the game. 
    This uses Ascii codes /033 to escape then uses the color code 31m for red and 34m for blue and 0m to reset the color for the rest of the out put
    EX "\033[31mX\033[0m" will turn X red
